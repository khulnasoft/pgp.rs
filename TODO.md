## TODOs & Future Improvements

### 1. Implement Core Functions
- Implement the `encrypt.rs`, `decrypt.rs`, `sign.rs`, `verify.rs`, `keygen.rs`, `export.rs`, and `import.rs` modules.

### 2. Add Persistence
- Store keys and configuration securely in a file or keyring.
- Implement the ability to list and manage keys stored in the keyring.

### 3. Refactor Code
- Extract common logic into utility functions or a separate module to reduce duplication across commands.

### 4. Improve Tests
- Expand the test suite for other commands such as export and import.
- Test edge cases, such as invalid keys, missing files, etc.

### 5. Enhance CLI
- Add additional flags or options to allow for more control over PGP operations, such as password protection or key expiration.

### 6. Encrypt/Sign Multiple Files
- Add functionality for batch encrypting or signing multiple files.

### 7. Error Handling
- Improve error handling by providing more descriptive error messages and validation.

### 8. Documentation
- Expand the `README.md` with detailed installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.

## Dependencies

- **`clap`**: Used for command-line argument parsing.
- **`rust-gnupg`** (or other PGP libraries): Used for interacting with PGP keys and performing encryption, decryption, signing, and verification.
- **`serde`** (optional): For serializing and deserializing data (useful if implementing key persistence).
